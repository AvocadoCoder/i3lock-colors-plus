i3lock-colors-plus

Developed by German Quero Jimenez, based on Pandoras Fox i3lock-colors.
It's just a simple code and config file that makes it easier to configure i3lock-colors.
It has 10 premade position configurations: 4 corners, two different mid position, mid right , mid left, top mid and bottom mid positions.

The config file it's just a text file, it has no sintax, the code just looks for the name of the variable is searching for and takes the value.
Because of that, there are certain words that are restringed in the config file(being caps sensitive):
	-iVERIFYING	
	-iWRONG		
	-iSTANDARD	
	-rVERIFYING	
	-rWRONG		
	-rSTANDARD	
	-hlKEY		
	-hlBACKSPACE	       	
	-SEPARATOR	
	-LINE		
	-VERIFYING	
	-WRONG		
	-LAYOUT		
	-TIME		
	-DATE		
	-PCNAME	
You can't also change the line of the value, it has to be in the same line. 


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
*		**Explanation**																*
*	It works with the grep fuction, looking for the respective name of the value and pasing it to awk, that prints the last block of the line:	*
*	Example line of code: -image=$(grep BACKGROUND config | awk '{printf $NF}')									*
*	It's made like that because it was the most legible and fast way I could think of, the config file is meant to be used just changing		*
*	the values of color cand background. If you find a better way to do it don't doubt to contact with me.						*
