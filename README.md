# i3lock-colors-plus
Developed by German Quero Jimenez, based on Pandoras Fox i3lock-colors.
It's just a simple code and config file that makes it easier to configure and use i3lock-colors.

Just clone it and include it into your $PATH, keep all archives in the "i3lock-colors-plus" folder for the code to work.
Don't change the name of the folder. Don't extract any file of the folder.
It has 10 premade position configurations: 4 corners, two different mid position, mid right , mid left, top mid and bottom mid positions.


Dependences:
  -i3lock-colors

Don't doubt contacting me if you have any suggest or idea of how to improve the code.
