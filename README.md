# i3lock-colors-plus
It's and advanced version of the PandorasFox's i3lock-colors, a simple code and config file that makes it easier to configure and use.


Just clone it and include it into your $PATH, keep all archives in the "i3lock-colors-plus" folder for the code to work.
Don't change the name of the folder. Don't extract any file of the folder.
It has 10 premade position configurations: 4 corners, two different mid position, mid right , mid left, top mid and bottom mid positions.


Don't doubt contacting me if you have any suggest or idea of how to improve the code.
